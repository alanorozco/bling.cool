This project uses [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) for package management.
[Install `yarn`,](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) then install
this project's dependencies through:

```sh
yarn
```

After that, you can build with:

```sh
gulp dist

This will output a single `dist/index.html` file. Other files in the `dist/`
directory can be safely ignored.
